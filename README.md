# CSC-303-Program-4.1
Create a class named StopWatch.  
The class contains:
- Private data fields startTime and stopTime with getter methods
- A no-arg constructor that initializes startTime and stopTime with the current time.
- A method named start() that sets the startTime to the current time
- A method named stop() that sets the stopTime to the current time
- A method named getElapsedtime() that returns the elapsed time for the stopwatch in milliseconds

Using your new StopWatch class, write a Java program that implements the algorithms and times them for various values of n. 

The program should display a table of the Big O, number of basic operations, and the run time of each algorithm for various values of n.
